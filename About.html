<h1>Harrison Smith: About Me</h1>

<p><b>
Summary    </b></p>
<p title=About Harrison Smith>
I am a motivated and hard-working recent college graduate who never wants to stop learning and is looking forward to growing at a reputable company for the long term. As of May 2020, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During my time at school, I was able to become a tutor, study abroad in England,  and participate in club wrestling while pursuing two degrees. Along with this, the people I've met have given me many different perspectives, and the friendships I've made will be without a doubt life long. My diverse coursework in business, analytics, statistics, and computer science has prepared me to take on any challenges that any career path has to offer.
